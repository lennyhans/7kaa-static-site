# Release of 2.13

### Posted on Dec 8, 2009 by jlac1024

We've reached our milestone for version 2.13 for Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries.  Nothing notable has changed in this version that requires download by clients, this was an internal version to work away from windows specific code and software.  We may still make this update available to windows users for download.
