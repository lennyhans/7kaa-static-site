# Seven Kingdoms 2 Repository Created

### Posted on Sept 19, 2010 by the3dfxdude

I would like to announce the start of Seven Kingdoms 2 project at 7kfans. The repository has been created with the last version of the game. This code will likely only compile with Visual Studio 6. Soon the game code will be cleaned up for later compilers, going through a similar build process as 7KAA.  The game code for 7K2 is under the GPL, however the game data is not.

Thanks to jlac1024 for arranging the project, licensing, and locating the code. Also thanks to Enlight for making this project possible.

Update: The initial 7K2 GPL source release will not compile for any system because the original FLC library cannot be included. The library will have to be replaced.
