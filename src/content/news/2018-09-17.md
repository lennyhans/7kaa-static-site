We've accomplished much of what we hoped for in the 2.14 series, with SDL2, multiplayer match-making, translation support, and now it's time to move to version 2.15. Everyone should get the latest version and try it out.

Windows 10 users that were using the pre-release build to address a Windows bug, should move to the current release.
