A few months ago Trevor Chan from [Enlight Software](http://www.enlight.com) released the source code for Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries.  He released it to us under this community project so that we can provide some long awaited bug fixes and address some other game-play issues.  This project is currently sponsored by Enlight and Trevor Chan.

Please stay posted for more information.
