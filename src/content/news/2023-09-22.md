Here it is! A release long in the making, which tackles issues with the AI,
such as smarter management, continuing assaults, and actually going on sea
based missions. Perhaps the AI will no longer be as easily tricked.

There has been some more quality of code improvements and testing to ensure
stability. Thanks to all the testers the past few weeks. Now on to the next
round of improvements. :)
