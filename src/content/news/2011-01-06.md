A new development version of 7KAA is now available. This release adds multiplayer again with SDL_net as a replacement to DirectPlay. Lobby development should soon begin testing on this version. The major porting work is mostly complete--now we get to move onto new stuff.

This version supports win32 (patch file provided this time) and linux 32-bit & 64-bit. I have tested playing a network game across linux 32-bit and windows successfully. Playing against mixed 64-bit and 32-bit clients might not work on this release, but it's definitely doable in a future release.

Thanks to those who have helped with this release -- unavowed and Mayan.

Please test this all-round. Windows users should give this version a try. Any problems? Report away!
