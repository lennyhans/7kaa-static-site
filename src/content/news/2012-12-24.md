# 7KAA 2.14.4

### Posted on Dec 24, 2012 by the3dfxdude

Development is still on-going, and I thought we should cut a release to get a version to people that have been waiting for some bug-fixes. Also we now have an installer for Windows users.

The new multiplayer lobby code is not completed, so expect trouble if you use that.

Let us know if this works or doesn't work for you. All feedback is very much appreciated.
