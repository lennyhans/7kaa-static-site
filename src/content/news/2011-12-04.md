Thanks to [Bjorn Lynne's](http://www.lynnemusic.com/) generous offer, we worked out the details, and now have the music freely available for use with the game again. I hope all of you can support him in his latest work where possible.

And those who have asked in the past, and got turned down, thank you for your patience. We really wanted to work this out properly, that is why we always had tough responses.

_Please note that the music is NOT GPL or public domain. The music may not be modified or re-recorded. It can only be used as intended with the game._

Here you may download the music, that can then be applied to your GPL version of the game. In the future, we will offer complete downloadable packages. Note that some linux distributions might choose not to include the music, so you may still get the music here if that is the case.

Note: The music comes in the installers we provide now. If you have a linux distro that does not provide it, instructions will be made available on how to add the music.
