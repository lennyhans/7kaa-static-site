# 7KAA 2.14.7

### Posted on Jun 4, 2017 by the3dfxdude

With this release, we have worked at improving usability of the 7K multiplayer service at 7kfans.com. We have added NAT punch-through support when using 7kfans.com, which will make online play easier and more reliable. Everyone should upgrade when they want to go online next time.

There have been game balancing changes and fixes, which will make the game more challenging. The Fryhtans can attack more often. Spies are more stealthy. The greater being mana exploit has been fixed. It may be harder to brutally capture towns. As with these kinds of changes, your feedback of testing the gameplay. We hope this has been an improvement.

This said, the game might not be trouble free. Desync issues likely lurk still. Your help in tracking down problems will be much appreciated.
