# Ten Year Anniversary

### Posted on 2019-09-03 by the3dfxdude

With the holiday here in the US, I had a much needed break from my daily job (the one that pays the bills), that I took the opportunity to get out for a change. I made it half way through the weekend, when I remember this past weekend was also the 10th year since this project website was created.
