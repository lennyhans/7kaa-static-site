# Development Update

### Posted on May 26, 2010 by the3dfxdude

As most of you that visit frequently know, we have released 7KAA patch version 2.13.2.  This version hopefully fixes the most annoying problems for Windows users.  If you haven't already, go to the [download site](../download/v2.13.2.html) and get it!

There is an on-going development branch for a version series called 2.14.xx.  Thanks to many people that have contributed so far.  The current thing slated for the first release in the new series is the ability to port the game from DirectX to alternative APIs such as SDL.  There won't be a stable release from 2.14 while this is all worked out. I will post a follow-up article asking for help in key areas in the future.
