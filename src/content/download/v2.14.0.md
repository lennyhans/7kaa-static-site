Previous version.

With this release, we have worked at improving usability of the 7K multiplayer service at 7kfans.com. We have added NAT punch-through support when using 7kfans.com, which will make online play easier and more reliable. Everyone should upgrade when they want to go online next time.

There have been game balancing changes and fixes, which will make the game more challenging. The Fryhtans can attack more often. Spies are more stealthy. The greater being mana exploit has been fixed. It may be harder to brutally capture towns. As with these kinds of changes, your feedback of testing the gameplay. We hope this has been an improvement.

This said, the game might not be trouble free. Desync issues likely lurk still. Your help in tracking down problems will be much appreciated.

Previous version.

Another great release here, this time adding back in lobby support similar to what was in the original game. With the in-game 7kfans.com service feature, you can use your forum name in-game, while being logged in to the forum with your web browser, and this will give you access to the assisted 7kfans.com match-making features.

This 2.14.xx series is now considered a stable branch of the tree for all users of the game. So everyone should start using this version, and move off the 2.13 version of the game. Besides, there are great additions to game thanks to everyone contributions in the community. This said, the game might not be trouble free, and there are likely cross-platform issues that will continue to be ironed out. Please give your reports and lets fix them!

## [#](download/#v2-14-5)2.14.5 _{2015-05-28}_
Previous version.

The latest version of 7KAA is now available. This version is long in the making, but perhaps has the most extensive set of improvements yet. The enet based network code supports up to 7 players, and direct connection via UDP, bringing it on par with the legacy DPlay code in 2.13.2. Those with widescreens may appreciate the higher resolution screen stretching that comes with SDL2. Those building from source please note the dependency changes.

### Summary of changes in this release

Switched to using SDL2.
Gained support for full-screen stretching.
Gained support for MacOS.
Switched to using enet, replacing SDL_net.
Audio code improvements.
The multiplayer connection code has stablized.
New game hotkeys.
Migrate population across extended town networks.
Added ability to migrate 10 people at a time across between towns.
Gettext translation support.
Several bug fixes.
Thanks to all who have contributed to this release.
