## Website change coming

### Posted on January 20th, 2022 by the3dfxdude

We are working on a new content management system for the website, which will replace Wordpress and the Wiki. If you have been following the Wordpress and MediaWiki RSS feed from this site, the new RSS feed url is:

[https://7kfans.com/rss.xml](https://7kfans.com/rss.xml)

Please update your reader by January 30th, because after that point, the old Wordpress feed will not be available.
