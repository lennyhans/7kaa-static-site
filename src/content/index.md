title : 'Seven Kingdoms Ancient Adversaries'
---

Seven Kingdoms is a real-time game of epic strategy and empire building. Players compete against up to six AI opponents or other players for control of land, trade, and peasants. Take control of any of seven emerging civilizations: Chinese, Persians, Japanese, Greeks, Normans, Vikings, or Mayans. Begin with a single, modest village under your command, and an entire world to be conquered by force of arms, by guile and persuasion, or by whatever other means you choose.

Wage open warfare on your rivals, or forge alliances with them. Send spies to infiltrate their ranks, or hold your spies back to guard against your enemies' prying eyes. Mine ore and manufacture goods, then build markets and establish trade routes to bring gold flowing into your coffers. Have your scientists research new weapons of war, or turn from science to the mystic arts, and seek the ultimate power: the ability to summon the aid of the gods. All these choices and more are yours to make.

The game is compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux.
